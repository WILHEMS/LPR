ONVIF / GSOAP by example
========================

In this example, I demonstrate how to retrieve a snapshot URI from an ONVIF complaint IP camera and download it locally.
You can view the complete blog post associated with this project on [my website](http://shoaib-ahmed.com/onvif-gsoap-in-c-by-example/).

The code is well commented and should be easy to read.


Prerequisites
-------------
You will need [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) to build the app.


Usage
-----
Clone the example code from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/Sufi-Al-Hussaini/onvif-gsoap-by-example
```

Now, all you have to do is:
```
cd onvif-by-example
make
```

Run the program:
```
./ipconvif -cIp '<camera-ip>' -cUsr '<camera-username>' -cPwd '<camera-password>'
```
